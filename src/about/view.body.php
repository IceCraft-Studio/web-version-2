        <p>
            We started in 2020 as a small Minecraft community collaborating on Bedrock maps and addons with other
            content creators. Throughout the years we've made a bunch of smaller projects and now we are happy to
            provide you a website where you can find all of our projects and also register to share your own.

            This website gets you simple by default ad-free exprience to find projects of all different kinds
            and anyone is welcome to upload their own to expand our ever growing collection.

            The main features of the website include creating a simple user profile for your presence on the website
            and once you have your profile you can publish your own projects into any of the categories
            we allow to be uploaded.

            The tutorial to use the website is <a href="https://github.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/blob/main/docs/Product.md">available on our GitHub.</a>
