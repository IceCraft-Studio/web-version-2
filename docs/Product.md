# How to use our website
This is a simple tutorial, with included images, showcasing how to use the various features of our website.

## Basics and navigation

The first page you'll likely encouter on the website is the homepage. There you can find here our logo, something about us and some recently published projects.

On the top you can find a simple navigation bar, there you can quickly get to the home page, projects page, about us, or to login/go to your profile.
The navigation bar highlights one link, however that doesn't always mean you are on that specific page, it may be a different page that's part of the same category. The link always leads to the main page of that category i.e. for "Projects" it's always `/projects`. You can also toggle the website wide theme 
for your browser, we recommend you to stick to the dark mode though (it's better :)

On smaller screens, the top bar tranforms into a hamburger menu. 

## Browsing Projects

The main thing our website offers is free and unrestricted access to all content our users upload. You can start browsing it by clicking on the project's link, that will bring you to the list of all projects on the website. There are links to listings of specific project categories, if you wish to only
see a specific kind of project. Any page that presents a variabe sized list of items on our website is paged. You can define certain parameters
of the presentation above the list, like the size of the page, sorting value and order. You can also jump to any page number here. You can find links to previous/next pages below the list. Here the list will always present you with project cards. On the project cards you can see a breif overview of what the project is about. 

There is a link to the creator's page above the project information, that leads to the list of project they have uploaded on our website.

When clicking on the project card, you will be brought on the page with full details about the project. It starts with a the creator link, title and a thumbnail. It continues with full description and article of the project. Just below that you can find links to the project's external page or direct download links.

## Register and Login

Now how you can get your projects on our website too.
By clicking the login link at the top of the website you are brought onto our login page.
Here you can input your credentials to login or click on the link below the form to register.

On the register page you are met with the requirements to join our website. All you need to do is select a valid available username and set a strong enough password. You can't change the username itself later, but you can change the name displayed.

## Profile Editing

Once you login or register you are redirected to your profile page. You can access it from anywhere at any time by clicking your avatar that's always on top of the website. Here you can see some basic information about your account and link to your public profile with all your projects. It's possible to change your profile picture or display name here too. You can also provide us your email to contact you if needed.

Another thing you can set here are public links to some accounts you might have on social media or your personal website. Change of password is also possible here. Just remember that changing your password means you have to re-login on other browsers.


## Project Uploading

The main part 

## Project Editing

Once your project's uploaded, you can of course edit it in its entirety at any time. The only thing you can't change is its category and slug.
The interface remains the exact same as when creating the project, besides being prefilled and gives you the ability to delete anything that's been previously uploaded.

## User Management

To manage users you can start by going to your profile. There you can notice a link under your role if you're an administrator. This link leads to a users page.


This page contains the list of all users on the website. It is only accessible by administrators. You can find your desired user here and then click on their username to see their public profile page.

If you are an administrator, this page will offer you a few options to manage the user. Please note that you can't manage other administrators, only the website owner can. You can change the user's password here. Other than that you can run one of the provided actions. 
- Ban / Unban user is the first option. This prevents the user from accessing their account. 
- The second option is to promote them to an administrator, just like you.
- The third one clear their display name.
- The last one removes all traces of them from the whole website. Dangerous!

As an administrator, you can also delete any project on the website. You are provided with the same button, just like the creator of the project.

## Wrapping up

So that's all our website can offer. We hope you find the experience on our website pleasent to use and enjoy your stay here!
