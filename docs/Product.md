# How to use our website
This is a simple tutorial, with included images, showcasing how to use the various features of our website.

## Basics and navigation

The first page you'll likely encouter on the website is the homepage. There you can find our logo, something about us and some recently published projects.

On the top you can find a simple navigation bar, there you can quickly get to the home page, projects page, about us, or to login/go to your profile.
The navigation bar highlights one link, however that doesn't always mean you are on that specific page, it may be a different page that's part of the same category. The link always leads to the main page of that category i.e. for "Projects" it's always `/projects`.

On smaller screens, the top bar tranforms into a hamburger menu.
