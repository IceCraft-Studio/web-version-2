# How to use our website

This is a simple tutorial, with included images, showcasing how to use the various features of our website.

## Basics and navigation

The first page you'll likely encouter on the website is the homepage. There you can find here our logo<sup>1)</sup>, something about us and some recently published projects<sup>2)</sup>.

![basics 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/basics-1.png)

On the top you can find a simple navigation bar, there you can quickly get to the **Home** page<sup>1)</sup>, **Projects** page<sup>2)</sup>, **About Us**<sup>3)</sup>, or to **login**/go to your **profile**<sup>4)</sup>.
The navigation bar highlights one link<sup>1)</sup>, however that doesn't always mean you are on that specific page, you may be on a different page that's part of the same category. The link always leads to the main page of that category i.e. for "Projects" it's always `/projects`. You can also toggle the website-wide color theme <sup>5)</sup>
for your browser, we recommend you to stick to the dark mode though (it's better :)

On smaller screens, the top bar tranforms into a hamburger<sup>1)</sup> menu<sup>2)</sup>.

## Browsing Projects

The main thing our website offers is free and unrestricted access to all content our users upload. You can start browsing it by clicking on the **Projects** navigation link, that will bring you to the list of all projects on the website. There are links to listings of specific project categories<sup>1)</sup>, if you wish to only
see a specific kind of project. Any page that presents a variable sized list of items on our website is paged. You can define certain parameters
of the presentation above the list<sup>2)</sup>, like the size of the page, sorting value and order. You can also jump to any page number here. 

![browsing 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/browsing-1.png)

You can find links to previous/next pages<sup>1)</sup> below the list of projects. Here the list will always present you with project cards. On the project cards you can see a breif overview of what the project is about<sup>2)</sup>.
There is a link to the creator's page<sup>3)</sup> above the project information, that leads to the list of project they have uploaded on our website.

![browsing 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/browsing-2.png)

When clicking on the project card, you will be brought on the page with full details about the project. It starts with a the creator link<sup>1)</sup>, title and a thumbnail<sup>2)</sup>. It continues with full description and article of the project<sup>3)</sup>. Just below that you can find links to the project's external page<sup>4)</sup> or direct download links<sup>5)</sup>.

![login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/login.png)

On the register page you are met with the requirements to join our website. All you need to do is select a valid available username and set a strong enough password. You can't change the username itself later, but you can change the name displayed.

## Profile Editing

Once you login or register you are redirected to your profile page. You can access it from anywhere at any time by clicking your avatar that's always on top of the website. Here you can see some basic information about your account<sup>1)</sup> and link to your public profile with all your projects.<sup>2)</sup> It's possible to change your profile picture<sup>3)</sup> or display name<sup>4)</sup> here too. You can also provide us your email<sup>5)</sup> to contact you if needed.

![profile 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/profile-1.png)

Another thing you can set here are public links to some accounts you might have on social media<sup>1)</sup> or your personal website<sup>2)</sup>. Change of password is also possible here<sup>3)</sup>. Just remember that changing your password means you have to re-login on other browsers.

## Project Uploading

The main bread and butter of our website is the projects so you obviously need some way to upload them. To upload a project, you need to login and the go to the **Projects** page. There on the top is a link to create a new project.<sup>1)</sup>

![upload 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/upload-1.png)

This brings you to an interactive page where you can customize your project. You can set basic stuff like title, description and thumbnail on the top<sup>1)</sup>, next to which is a preview of the project card so you can tell if it looks good right away<sup>2)</sup>. Below are 2 important buttons - slug and category selection.<sup>3)</sup> First you select the category of you project and then you are allowed to select a unique end of your project's URL, which is the slug.

![upload 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/upload-2.png)

Next important part of your project is the article you present the viewer with. It can be a short one or a longer one. You create it using the standard
markdown format<sup>1)</sup> and you can upload images<sup>2)</sup> like screenshots or other illustrations to put directly inside of it. When you're done creating the markdown, you can preview its rendered result by clicking the preview button<sup>3)</sup>.

![upload 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/upload-3.png)

Last, but very important, part of you project is the links. You can find it just on the bottom of the page before the final "Create Project" button<sup>1)</sup>.
There you need to put at least one link<sup>2)</sup> or file<sup>3)</sup> to your project. You can upload up to 5 of each. The files can be up to 30 MB in size.

![upload 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/upload-4.png)

Once your done creating, you will be redirected to your project's final page. An example of well created projects can be found over at [my page](https://zwa.toad.cz/~dobiapa2/users/paveldobcz23)!

## Project Editing

Once your project's uploaded, you can of course edit it in its entirety at any time. To enter the edit page, you have to use the link you can find on top of your project's page<sup>1)</sup>. You can also delete your project using the link next to it<sup>2)</sup>. 

![editing-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/editing-1.png)

The only thing you can't change about your project is its category and slug.<sup>1)</sup>
The interface remains the exact same as when creating the project, besides being prefilled and it gives you the ability to delete anything that's been previously uploaded.<sup>2)</sup>

## User Management

To manage users you can start by going to your profile. There you can notice a link<sup>1)</sup> under your role if you're an administrator. This link leads to a users page.

![admin 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/admin-1.png)

This page contains the list of all users on the website. It is only accessible by administrators. You can find your desired user here and then click on their username<sup>1)</sup> to see their public profile page.

![admin 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/admin-2.png)

If you are an administrator, this page will offer you a few options to manage the user and show you their email<sup>1)</sup> to contact them. Please note that you can't manage other administrators, only the website owner can. You can change the user's password here<sup>2)</sup>. Other than that you can run one of the provided actions. <sup>3)</sup>
-   Ban / Unban user is the first option. This prevents the user from accessing their account.
-   The second option is to promote them to an administrator, just like you.
-   The third one clear their display name.
-   The forth option lets you clear their profile picture.
-   The last one removes all traces of them from the whole website. **Dangerous!**

![admin 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCraft-Studio/web-version-2/refs/heads/main/docs/images/admin-3.png)

As an administrator, you can also delete any project on the website. You are provided with the same button, just like the creator of the project.
