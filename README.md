# Studio IceCraft Web Project

This is a repository for the Studio IceCraft Website Version 2.0

This website's basic design was inspired by the original [static Studio IceCraft website](https://github.com/IceCraft-Studio/IceCraft-Studio.github.io).

This version is a complete rewrite in PHP expanding the scope of the website with dynamic features.

It was made as part of a semestral project for ZWA classes on ČVUT FEL by Pavel Dobiáš in the winter semester of the 2025/2026 academic year.
